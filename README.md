# A large-scale MEG and EEG dataset for object recognition in naturalistic scenes
This repository provides the codebase for the preprocessing, validation, and visualization associated with the NOD-MEEG: *A Large-Scale MEG and EEG Dataset for Object Recognition in Naturalistic Scenes*.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following primary subdirectories:

- **[resources](https://github.com/colehank/NOD-MEEG/tree/main/resources)**: Contains preprocessing models and Representational Dissimilarity Matrice (RDM) derived from the NOD-fMRI dataset.
- **[scripts](https://github.com/colehank/NOD-MEEG/tree/main/scripts)**: Includes the core implementation for data preprocessing, visualization, and technical validation.
- **[src](https://github.com/colehank/NOD-MEEG/tree/main/src)**: Provides general-purpose utility functions and classes for preprocessing workflows and validation procedures applied in this study.
